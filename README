what to persist so that reconstruct easy:
1. attributes
2. attributeCount
3. attributeValues


===============================
tables: user, project, attribute, attribute_value tables
relation: user_project one-many, project_attribute one-many, 'attribute_attribute_value' one-many

>> using above representation, for a given user we can get his/her project. from project we get list of attributes and from attributes we get list of attribute values.

===================================

timeseries data representation:
data_item table: (data_id, col, row, value)
relation: project_'data_item' one-many

>> for a particular project, we can get all data IDs and therefore get all individual data items to construct the table again.
>> how many time columns: max value of 'col'
