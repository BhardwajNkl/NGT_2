1. First see the demo to have an understanding of the flow.
    >> To use the app
        >> create a database with name as "ngt3"
        >> run node app.js
        >> signup and signin
        >> If you have already created your forecast project, it will show. Otherwise, you get the option to create it.

    >> While creating project:
        >> provide attribute (such as: country)
        >> provide values for that attribute. Comma seperated. (such as: India, Australia, America)
        >> add as many attributes as you need.
    
    >> while working on forecast project
        >> when you update a non-total cell, all the parent totals get updated instantly.
        >> when you update a total cell, all the children cells are updated based on ratio of existing values or ratio from previous column. YOU NEED TO HIT 'ENTER' after inserting a total.

        >> save is for saving the state of your project in database.
        >> copy: first select any cell of the column you want to copy and then click on copy button.
        >> paste: first click on any cell of the target column and click paste button.
        NOTE: entire column is copy/pasted.

2. Next tasks:
    1. implement logout.
    2. change the UI
        >> sign in, registration and home all pages. wherever you see a chance for improvet.
        >> 'add time series column', 'save', 'copy' and 'paste'.

    NOTE: after every change, make sure the code does not break. It is highly likely as the code, specially the frontend code, is not very well structured.
